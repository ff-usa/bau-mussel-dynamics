### Introduction

Freshwater pearl mussel *Lamellidens marginalis* is a commercially
important aquatic species in Bangladesh. But little research has been
done about the seasonality of its yield. We conducted a year-long
study at a culture pond in Bangladesh to understand the temporal
variation of mussel population. We used quadrat sampling method
to estimate the natural population of *L. marginalis* in the lentic habitat.
Thereby, we tried to establish the months of minimum and maximum mussel yields.
Simultaneously, we recorded a few water quality parameters to assess their
impacts on mussel growth.

Our collected data of mussel samples, their biometric measurements, and
concomitant water quality parameters are released via this GitHub repository.
Moreover, we made all our R codes available here to facilitate future
fisheries management research.

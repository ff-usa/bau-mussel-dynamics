### Monthly population variation of freshwater pearl mussel

The three quadrats are denoted by i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, i<sub>3</sub>

![](population.png)

Population density is minimum in September and maximum in April.

### Strong correlation between population and depth of pond

![](corr_population_depth.png)

p<0.05 indicates significant correlation.

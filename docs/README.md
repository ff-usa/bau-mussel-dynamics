### Monthly population variation of freshwater pearl mussel

![](population.png)

Population density is minimum in September and maximum in April.

---

### Strong correlation between population and depth of pond

![](corr_population_depth.png)

p<0.05 indicates significant correlation.

---

### Normality of shell dimensions

![](qqplot_length.png)

The Shapiro-Wilk test statistics is W = 0.95837, p = 0.7603. The Q-Q plot and p>0.05 indicate normal distribution.
